The chatbot can be used be used in wide scale health checkups where it is not feasible for doctors to consult large amount of patients one on one.

The chatbot assistant uses Regular Expressions (Regex) to extract the relevant input from the user.

The loop logic used for diagnosis of each health parameter is based on a specifically set If-else loop.
